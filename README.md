### Classification by Commonsense Types

According to the commonsense types (see Appendix for more background on commonsense types), causality can be roughly classified into four categories:

1. **Physical Causality**  
   Physical causality refers to the cause-effect relationships grounded in the physical world. It typically covers domains such as physics, chemistry, and environmental science. Example datasets include: CRAFT ([Ates et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-acl.205)), e-CARE ([Du et al., 2022](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.33)). 

2. **Social Causality**  
   Social causality involves understanding social norms, cultures, human behavior, intents, and reactions. For instance, criticism (cause) can lead to depression (effect) in a social context. It covers domains like law, culture, education, and psychology. Example datasets include: ATOMIC ([Sap et al., 2019](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1454)), GLUCOSE ([Mostafazadeh et al., 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.185)), IfQA ([Yu et al., 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-main.515)), etc. 

3. **Biological Causality**  
   Biological causality relates to cause-effect pairs that govern biological processes and phenomena, such as how a healthy diet contributes to longevity. Example datasets include: BioCause ([Mihuailua et al., 2013](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-2)), CBND ([Boue et al., 2015](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1077)), etc. 

4. **Temporal Causality**  
   Temporal causality involves the sequential understanding that a cause must precede an effect in time. Example datasets include: Temporal-Causal ([Bethard et al., 2008](https://aclanthology.org/L08-1018/)), CausalTimeBank ([Mirza et al., 2014](https://aclanthology.org/W14-0702)), CaTeRs ([Mostafazadeh et al., 2016](https://aclanthology.org/W16-1007)), etc.

## Reasoning Methods over Commonsense Causality

### Qualitative Causal Reasoning
Qualitative causal reasoning focuses on classifying cause-effect relationships in a binary fashion, often bypassing uncertainty through simplification.
